                    When I was designing my site, I decided on my content based on my plans for each animal and character in the website's background.  I did get help from AI to help make the lines from scientist characters sound a bit more intelligent, 
                    but all the design decisions were 100% me. I looked up some of my images with Google search, and looked for pictures of the animals I had pages on using Wikipedia and Google.
                    Communication with the lead developer was a bit unresponsive than I would like, and it took a bit to get my site's URL, but the site turned out pretty good.  I wish the team was a bit better about correcting errors when I pointed them out, but you can't have everything, I guess.
                    Next time I hire a team to do a project for me, I'll probably ask for my url immediately, but I'm not sure what else I could do.

                    As a lead developer, I had an interesting time figuring out the design and particular color pallete from the sketches my client gave me.  He didn't give a lot of detail, and it took a week or so to get in contact with him so he could give us more information, but we mostly got there in the end.  
                    Communication with my junior devs was spotty during Thanksgiving week, but we figured everything out the next week.  My junior developers and I communicated well, and when there was any lack of communication I talked to them during class to sort it out.  I didn't have any trouble publishing my client's 
                    site, but sending the URL to him had to wait until the next class when he was there, due to a lack of response from the client over email.  Managing the github wasn't very hard, though I did have to reinvite one of my junior developers after he missed the first invite and it timed out.
