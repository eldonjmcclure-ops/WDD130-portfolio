    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>My purpose for this website is to provide trips into the great outdoors for 
      adventurous individuals and groups, focusing on white water rafting but also 
      including camping and other outdoor adventures.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience I expect to visit this site are adventurous youth, 
      young adults, and older adults.  They will likely be in good financial situations,
      if they are considering a white-water rafting trip.  They may be older adults who have 
      a family with older children, or they are young adults.  These groups of people will have 
      their own devices, so it's important that we make the site accessible on multiple types of 
      computers and handheld devices (phones, tablets, etc).</p>
