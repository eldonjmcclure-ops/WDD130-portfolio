                    When I was designing my site, I decided on my content based on my plans for each animal and character in the website's background.  I did get help from AI to help make the lines from scientist characters sound a bit more intelligent, 
                    but all the design decisions were 100% me. I looked up some of my images with Google search, and looked for pictures of the animals I had pages on using Wikipedia and Google.
                    Communication with the lead developer was a bit unresponsive than I would like, and it took a bit to get my site's URL, but the site turned out pretty good.  I wish the team was a bit better about correcting errors when I pointed them out, but you can't have everything, I guess.
                    Next time I hire a team to do a project for me, I'll probably ask for my url immediately, but I'm not sure what else I could do.

                    As a lead developer, I had an interesting time figuring out the design and particular color pallete from the sketches my client gave me.  He didn't give a lot of detail, and it took a week or so to get in contact with him so he could give us more information, but we mostly got there in the end.  
                    Communication with my junior devs was spotty during Thanksgiving week, but we figured everything out the next week.  My junior developers and I communicated well, and when there was any lack of communication I talked to them during class to sort it out.  I didn't have any trouble publishing my client's 
                    site, but sending the URL to him had to wait until the next class when he was there, due to a lack of response from the client over email.  Managing the github wasn't very hard, though I did have to reinvite one of my junior developers after he missed the first invite and it timed out.

                    As a junior developer, I had interesting experiences in both teams I was a part of.  One team had a dedicated lead developer and a clear site plan, so we didn't need to communicate all that much.  When she needed to communicate, our lead developer was clear and stated what she needed, 
                    and she was prompt in finishing the index HTML and editing our headers so they matched with the updates she made.  Adding the changes to Github was fine, though somwhere along the line I forgot to send a pull request and ended up a bit behind.  I enjoyed working on that project, 
                    though it did lack a bit of communication and team connection.  We just did our jobs, nothing more.

                    My other lead developer was...absent, let's say.  He didn't add the other junior developer in our team to the group chat, and basically didn't do much to help make the site.  This included syncing my changes to Github, which had me feeling like all my work was going to waste.  Because of this, 
                    I ended up slightly ignoring the project and didn't get as much done as I probably could have.  However, this really gave me perspective on how important it was to communicate and put effort into being a good lead developer, which I then tried to implement in the project over which I was lead developer.
